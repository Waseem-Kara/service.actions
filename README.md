# Actions Platform

## Overview

The Unified Actions Platform is a solution designed to handle fetching of actions by codewords. Built with FastAPI and React with TypeScript, this platform has a backend API and a web interface.

### Features

- **REST API**: Developed using FastAPI, the backend exposes endpoints for fetching actions. It supports querying actions by codeword and retrieving codewords based on action ids.
- **Web UI**: A modern, responsive web interface built with React and TypeScript. It provides a UI for submitting codewords or action ids and displays the results.


## Getting Started

To get the platform up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Waseem-Kara/service.actions.git

2. **Run the FastAPI backend**:
    ```bash
    cd actions_api
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m uvicorn app.main:app

3. **Launch the React frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd ui/actions-ui
    npm install
    npm start

## Accessing the API

Once the FastAPI backend server is up and running, you can explore and test the API endpoints through its autogenerated documentation:

- **Swagger UI**: Visit [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs) for the Swagger UI interface, which allows you to execute API calls directly from the browser.
- **ReDoc**: For an alternative documentation format, check out [http://localhost:3000/redoc](http://localhost:3000/redoc), which provides a more readable overview of the available endpoints.

## Viewing the Web UI

The web UI, developed with React and TypeScript. After starting the React development server, you can access the web UI at:

- [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
